Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a model by iteratively adjusting its parameters. It works as follows:

1. **Initialize**: Start with initial values for the model's parameters.
2. **Calculate Gradient**: Compute the gradient (partial derivatives) of the cost function with respect to each parameter.
3. **Update Parameters**: Adjust the parameters in the direction opposite to the gradient to reduce the cost function.
4. **Iterate**: Repeat the process until the changes in the cost function become negligible or a set number of iterations is reached.

The learning rate determines the size of the steps taken towards minimizing the cost function.
